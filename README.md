# PA-LIKE-ConcertOrganiser

A Concert Organiser company organises three kinds of concerts: indoor, outdoor and festival concerts.

● Store every concert’s main band, warm up band, capacity, style (depends on the main band).
●Different venues have different capacity and duration, indoor concerts can hold 3000 people, and take 1,5 hours,
outdoor concerts hold 5000 people, and take 2 hours and festivals take 6 hours, with 8000 people at the same
time. 

● Unfortunately outdoor concerts have to be cancelled in case of raining (with 30% chance).
<br>●Ticket prices are somewhere between 12000-15000 Ft (one concert has only one kind of tickets).
<br>● Each concert has a full house with 80% chance. If not, 70%-80% of tickets are sold.
They have also bands to work with: Main and Warm up bands.
<br>● Every band has a name and a style (Rock, Pop or Jazz).
<br>● Main bands got to decide who is going to cheer up the crowd before they get to the stage. The first Warm up band
who has the same style wins this honor.

Let’s talk about alcohol a bit:
<br>● Every guest is a huge beer fan. They drink 1 pint of beer every half an hour. Beer prices are the following: indoor -
600 Ft, outdoor - 800 Ft, festival - 1000 Ft.
Calculate the company’s profit from 10 concerts. They can keep 40% of the ticket sales and the full income from the bar.
